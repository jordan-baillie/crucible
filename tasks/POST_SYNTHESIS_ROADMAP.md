# Post-Synthesis Roadmap — what happens next, and when (2026-06-12)

The synthesis is done; the system now runs itself nightly. From here the work changes character:
**less building, more evidence-watching.** Dates below are derived from the board's frozen go-live
policy (memo 2026-06-09, 5-0) and the actual evidence counters as of today.

## The two forward books — evidence horizon

| | val_mom_trend_smallcap | amihud_illiq_tranched_v3 |
|---|---|---|
| deployed | 2026-06-10 | 2026-06-12 (clean redeploy after capital/tif bugs) |
| return days | 3 / 20 needed (G2) | 0 / 20 |
| fills | 99 / 40 needed (G1) ✅ | 0 / 40 |
| expectancy (G3) | -21bps/day (3 days = noise; not meaningful before ~day 15) | — |
| earliest G1–G7 all-scoreable | **~2026-07-08** (20 trading days) | **~2026-07-10** |
| watch items | first OPG fills vs G6 slippage bar (16bps); G7 broker-error reset after the 4 rejected-OPG errors | first clean OPG submission TODAY 10:30 AEST; capital now $5K design size |

Weekly cadence: crucible-forward-evidence (Fri) scores G1–G7 + lifecycle transitions.
Both books flip lifecycle shadow → evidence at ~20 days (early July). Decay rule needs 60 return
days + 2 weekly confirms → earliest possible decay flag ~September (by design — no false urgency).

## The go-live decision — what it will actually look like (board policy, frozen)

Real capital requires ALL of:
1. **Forward-paper gate PASS** (G1–G7: ≥40 fills, ≥20 days, +expectancy, ≥2 regimes, recon clean,
   slippage ≤2× modeled, broker errors <1%) — earliest ~mid-July for val_mom.
2. **AUM floor, unit-economics-derived**: ~$10–15K for micro-tradable cross-asset; **~$25K for
   borrow-dependent equity** (both our current books are smallcap equity — the HIGHER bar applies).
3. **Kill-switch live-tested + human sign-off** (board: one pre-approved ≤$250 "first-blood canary"
   on the first shadow-cleared pass — tuition, not a bet).
4. Stage D allocator (task #7, board-deferred) sizes across books in lifecycle
   evidence/real_capital_candidate only — its input contract shipped with Stage 3.

So the realistic go-live shape: **val_mom or tranched_v3 clears G1–G7 in July → becomes
real_capital_candidate → still waits on the $25K AUM floor** (account is $14.4K paper; real AUM
far below). The binding constraint is AUM, not evidence. The unlock paths are (a) capital
deposit decision (human/board), or (b) a NATIVELY micro-tradable PASS (cross-asset/futures)
where the floor is only $10–15K — which is exactly why the board said BOREAS-first.

## BOREAS thread (the board's preferred first real-capital venue)

- **CORRECTION 2026-06-12 (stale date caught during IB-adapter scoping):** the 2026-08-28 carry
  verdict WILL NEVER ARRIVE — it was the Midas forward demo, and Midas was killed 2026-06-10
  (wiki overview "binding events"). The carry+trend book is ORPHANED; re-openable only via a
  fresh carry leg + its own fresh ~3-month forward run (most likely candidate: the elite-pool
  crypto delta-neutral funding-carry NEAR-MISS, if a variant ever clears stage-1+holdout).
- The IB micro adapter therefore has **no hard deadline** — but remains the highest-value
  build: it is the venue for ANY futures/cross-asset PASS (the $10–15K AUM floor vs $25K for
  borrow-dependent equity is exactly why the board said BOREAS-first). New trigger discipline:
  adapter must be live-verified before any futures-tradable book STARTS its forward run, so
  the ~3-month forward window doubles as the execution-path shakedown.
- Scouting result (2026-06-12): adapter is ~80% BUILT in atlas (brokers/ib + brokers/ib_web,
  micro-futures table, 169 broker tests pass). Remaining work is operational — IB paper
  account, CP-Gateway session keepalive, end-to-end order verification, futures sizing/roll
  policy. Full phased plan: atlas tasks/IB_MICRO_ADAPTER_PLAN.md.

## Forge-side maturation (no code — data accumulating on timers)

| trigger | threshold | ETA at 3 smiths × 3 cycles/night |
|---|---|---|
| Thompson bandit fit over arms | ≥60 arm-labelled outcomes | ~late June (counting started 2026-06-12, 2/60) |
| Regime-coverage demotion activates | 2026-06-26 (phase-in ends) | fixed date |
| Regime-burner falsifiability review | 60 days / ≥20 stage-1 evals | ~mid-August |
| Retirement-rule falsifiability review | 2 quarters of live books | ~December |
| FABLE-5 revert to $0 models | **2026-06-22 06:00 AEST (auto-timer)** | watch: smith quality may shift post-revert — compare arm rewards before/after |

## Standing verification (this week)

1. Tomorrow AM: first full-system forge night — arm draws (organic crossover?), regime-burner
   lines on new experiment pages, consistency severity distribution, no elite.record exceptions.
2. First OPG fills for both books → G6 slippage with auction prints (the 2026-06-11 fix's payoff).
3. Watch tranched_v3's day-1 book build (the redeployed $5K/opg config's first live cycle).

## What I am explicitly NOT doing

- Not adding gates (stack FROZEN). Not fitting the bandit early. Not building Stage D before AUM.
- Not touching the two forward books' configs while evidence accumulates (any change resets the
  evidence clock — the worst trade available).

## Banked (2026-06-12): context-architecture findings — reopen trigger = June 22 model revert

From "Building a Good Vertical Agent" (Peter Wang / Shortcut, deployed in 3 of top-4 multistrat
funds): agent = faithful compression of its task distribution; context as L1/L2/L3 cache. Crucible
already ~85% aligned (one-module substrate, consequence-reporting verdicts, error-pair memory,
severity triage). Two banked gaps, NOT building while the synthesized system stabilizes:
1. **Conditional CONTRACT assembly** — codegen contract is all-L1; include sections keyed off
   proposal fields (market/data_source/hedge) so e.g. crypto proposals don't pay for SF1/PIT gotchas.
2. **L3 for the fix loop** — fix() retry prompt should include the actual SDK source implicated by
   the traceback (triage does this; codegen doesn't).
TRIGGER: Fable-5 reverts to weaker $0 models 2026-06-22. Weaker smiths need more curated context
("tiers slide with model strength"). Compare June 16–21 vs June 23–28: consistency severity
distribution, codegen_attempts/empty retries, arm rewards. Degradation ⇒ pull lever #1, then #2.
