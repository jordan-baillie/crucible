You are a quant research agent. Propose EXACTLY ONE new, untested strategy hypothesis to test next.
HARD CONSTRAINTS (from the wiki above):
- Must be a RISK PREMIUM or a COMBINATION of complementary premia — NOT a standalone prediction edge in a liquid market.
- Must NOT duplicate any existing experiment and must NOT violate any anti-pattern or closed decision.
- Must be data-FEASIBLE on the OWNED/FREE data in the DATA CATALOG above (for US equities PREFER survivorship-clean Sharadar SEP/SF1 via sep_panel/us_universe/sf1, NOT yfinance). If it would need a DATA-GATED source, set prior=low and state exactly what's missing in gate0_data_check.
- Prefer: combinations of validated legs, complementary premia (opposite tails), or less-efficient corners.
- DIVERSIFY — do NOT propose yet another variant of a premium that already appears 2+ times in the experiments/queue above. If one theme (e.g. PEAD/SUE) is already well-represented, pick a DIFFERENT premium or market entirely.
- CROWDING/DECAY — PREFER novel inefficiencies in less-arbitraged corners over heavily-published factors. Famous factors (betting-against-beta/low-vol, value, momentum, size) are CROWDED -> decayed + regime-fragile (cf. BAB: passed every single-universe gate but FAILED cross-market and is heavily published). If you propose a known premium, it must be a genuinely under-exploited IMPLEMENTATION or corner.
- DEPLOYABILITY (board 2026-06-09 — avoid STRANDED ALPHA) — a pass is only valuable if it can be TRADED at retail scale (~$5K, IB/Alpaca, no special borrow). STRONGLY PREFER: long-only or long-tilt equity books in liquid-enough names, futures-implementable premia (IB micro-futures: equity index, rates, FX, metals, energy), ETF-implementable cross-asset books, crypto perps (small size). AVOID proposing strategies whose construction REQUIRES: shorting illiquid/hard-to-borrow names (micro-cap short legs are NOT borrowable at retail), gross leverage >2x, intraday execution, or options/OTC structures we cannot route. A long/short CROSS-SECTIONAL design is acceptable ONLY if the short leg is liquid large/mid-caps or an index hedge (e.g. short SPY/sector ETF vs the long book). If the cleanest test of the premium is long-short but a deployable long-only/index-hedged variant exists, PROPOSE THE DEPLOYABLE VARIANT.

ELITE STRATEGY to EVOLVE (fitness/DSR {elite.get('fitness')}):
{json.dumps(elite.get('proposal'), indent=2)}

Propose ONE targeted MUTATION to make it MORE ROBUST or GENERALISE better — e.g. a different/broader universe,
a complementary leg, a cleaner/lower-turnover construction, a regime filter, a cost-hardening. Keep what worked;
fix the fragile part. DEPLOYABILITY: the mutated construction must stay retail-tradable at ~$5K (IB/Alpaca;
no illiquid short legs, no >2x gross leverage) — mutating TOWARD deployability (e.g. long-only/index-hedged
variant) is itself a high-value mutation. This is an EVOLUTION of THIS strategy, NOT a new idea, and must still
obey the anti-patterns and use owned/free data. Return ONLY the SAME JSON proposal object (title, premium, market, data_source,
free_or_owned, signal_approach, why_not_duplicate, prior, pairs_with, gate0_data_check, crowding_risk, scope,
