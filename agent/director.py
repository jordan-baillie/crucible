"""Director: keep the shared work queue topped with deduped, prioritized, UNTESTED hypotheses.

Runs under the 'director' lock so only one top-up happens at a time even if several workers
invoke it when the queue runs dry. Dedup is against recorded experiments + everything in-flight
(queued/claimed), so N workers never get the same hypothesis.
