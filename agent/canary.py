"""Gate canary — mutation testing for the gate stack ("gates rot" defense).

A frozen battery of KNOWN-BAD strategies, each designed to be killed by ONE designated
gate. Run weekly (crucible-lint.timer). Any canary that fully PASSES the rails means a
gate has rotted -> loud Telegram alert + nonzero exit. Lesson origin: I3 — the regime
gates passed vacuously for months and nothing noticed.

Isolation: ri.configure() points holdout-ledger/FDR-registry state at a throwaway dir,
and run_experiment(write_wiki=False, alert=False) — canaries never touch the production
registry, never burn real holdout entries, never write wiki pages, never alert PASS.

Assertion hierarchy per canary:
  HARD  PASSED_ALL_GATES must be False           -> violation = RED alert (gate stack breached)
  SOFT  the DESIGNATED gate actually fired       -> miss = YELLOW warning (canary blocked
        earlier than its target gate — that gate went UNTESTED this run; battery degraded)

Usage: python3 -m agent.canary
