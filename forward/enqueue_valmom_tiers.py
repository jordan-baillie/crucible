"""Queue the per-tier re-tune+re-validate Value×Momentum books for a TRUE multi-tier portfolio.

2026-06-09 CPCV-hardened generalization proved: the V+M MECHANISM is real in every cap tier
(OOS-positive, CPCV-median-positive, 100% positive paths) BUT a config tuned on one tier does NOT
transfer (PBO 0.71-0.97 out-of-tier; low ONLY on its own discovery tier). To SCALE the edge we need
a tier-NATIVE book per cap tier — grid searched ON that tier so the default ranks robustly there.
Small-cap is already clean (trend_overlay, PBO 0.078). Queue the LARGE and MID native books here.
