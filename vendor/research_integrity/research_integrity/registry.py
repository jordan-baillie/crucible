"""Rail 2 — hypothesis registry (cross-family multiple-testing context).

The effective-N DSR (search_history.py) corrects for the config search WITHIN a strategy. It does
NOT correct for the thousands of DISTINCT ideas an industrialized loop throws at the gate. This
registry logs every battery run's FAMILY (coarse hypothesis class) so the PROMOTION bar can escalate
with the cumulative count of distinct ideas tested (see adapter.promote_dsr). Counting FAMILIES, not
configs, avoids both under- and over-counting (the grid is already DSR-deflated within a family).

Append-only JSONL, pure/deterministic except file I/O. Spec: research/INTEGRITY_RAILS_SPEC.md (Rail 2).
