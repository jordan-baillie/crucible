"""research_integrity — shared research-integrity rails (portfolio-wide).

The methodology that caught Atlas's survivorship mirage + a DSR-0.986 holdout failure, packaged so
EVERY edge-search project (Hermes, Midas, Credibility, Atlas) is validated to the same standard
instead of reinventing the harness.

Three rails + a cross-OOS battery, all PURE functions over a per-period return series + trade list,
so they bolt onto ANY project's backtest/walk-forward output:

  cross-OOS battery : assemble_bundle(returns, trades, grid) -> evaluate_tiers(...)  [cpcv/PBO/DSR/regime]
  Rail 1 holdout    : holdout_gate(...) + config_hash + single-use ledger (quarantine train, test once)
  Rail 2 FDR bar    : promote_dsr(n_families) + registry (distinct_families) — across-hypothesis MTC
  Rail 3 deployment : deployment_sanity(trades, ...) — did the strategy actually deploy as designed

Per-project state (holdout config, ledger, registry) lives under $RESEARCH_INTEGRITY_DIR (default cwd).
Each project writes its OWN holdout/deployment runner and calls the pure gates;
other projects supply their own runner (produce returns+trades) and call the gates. See README.md.
