"""Rail 3 — Deployment-sanity (SHARED research-integrity infra).

PROJECT-AGNOSTIC: deployment_sanity/expected_positions are pure. (the old `deployment_smoke` ATLAS
reference runner. For non-equity projects (e.g. Hermes betting) define your own thresholds/analog
(bets/day, game spread, single-game share) or call deployment_sanity on bet-trade dicts. Original:

A cross-OOS battery TIER is meaningless unless the strategy actually trades the book it was
designed for. 2026-06-05: cross_sectional_momentum "PROMOTEd" (DSR 0.926) while a sector-tag bug
capped it to 2 concurrent positions; the "edge" lived in the top 1-2 names. Properly deployed (~14)
it FAILED. A human caught it; at 1000 runs/day no human will. This module auto-FAILs such artifacts.

Spec: research/INTEGRITY_RAILS_SPEC.md (Rail 3). Lesson: tasks/lessons.md 2026-06-05.
Thresholds are PRE-REGISTERED and FROZEN here.

# Origin: two genuine Amihud near-misses (holdout Sharpe 1.44/1.31) were force-failed on
# single_name_share because their PRE-REGISTERED index-ETF residual-beta hedge dominated
# position-days. The gate could not tell a declared hedge instrument from an accidental
# concentration bet. Design (anti-loophole, each invariant tested in crucible
# tests/test_hedge_sleeve.py):
#   1. hedge tickers must be on THIS frozen broad-index-ETF whitelist — a single stock can
#      never be declared a "hedge" to dodge concentration.
#   2. the ALPHA book is judged ALONE: hedge trades are excluded from ALL deployment metrics
#      (trade count, concurrency, single-name/sector share), so a thin alpha book cannot
#      hide behind hedge bulk — exclusion makes every other check STRICTER, not looser.
#   3. hedge share of total position-days must stay <= the declared cap (and the hard
#      ceiling below) — an oversized "hedge" is index-substitution in disguise; the
#      beta-confound gate (harness stage-1) independently catches the return-side version.
#   4. no declaration -> byte-identical legacy behavior (frozen designs unaffected).
